# remark-preset-davidtheclark

My remark preset, for keeping Markdown documentation tidy.

Validation:

- Links within the repository (to headings, other files, headings in other files) are validated.
- A table of contents will be generated if you include a `Table of contents` header in a document.

Syntax:

- Unordered list items marked with `-`.
- List items indented only one space beyond the markder.
- Emphasis and strong are both indicated with `*`.
- Code blocks are fenced with triple backticks.
- `atx`-style headings, the ones that (just) start with `#` signs, e.g. `## Second-level heading`.
- Other stuff that should be intuitive or prevent mistakes.
